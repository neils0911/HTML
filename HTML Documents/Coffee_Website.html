<p>Here is a quote from Wikipedia about the origin of the Cappuccino:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappuccino">
The name comes from the Capuchin friars, referring to the colour of their habits,[5] and in this context referring to the colour of the beverage when milk is added in small portion to dark, brewed coffee[6] (today mostly espresso).
The physical appearance of a modern cappuccino with espresso créma and steamed milk is a result of a long evolution of the drink. 
The Viennese bestowed the name "Kapuziner", possibly in the 18th century, on a version that included whipped cream and spices of unknown origin. The Italian cappuccino was unknown outside Italy until the 1930s, and seems to be born out of Viennese-style cafés in Trieste and other Italian areas in Austria-Hungary through the Kapuziner coffee in the early 20th century. 
The drink spread from Trieste, the main coffee port in Central Europe, throughout Italy, especially after World War I and later worldwide, and can be found at a number of establishments.
